<h1><span class="fminitial">1. </span>Blender
</h1>
<p>Blender is a software that is used for creating 3D content.
Primarily this means you can make three dimensional images. However,
you can also add sound, and make it time-based and interactive. This
makes Blender ideal for a wide range of uses including creating 3D
models, rendering, post -production, story boarding, creating
animations, making movies, creating 3D 'programs', and making
interactive environments and games.

<h1><span class="fminitial">2. </span>Blender's Unique Interface</h1>
<p> Â­It's no secret that the Blender interface breaks a lot of rules.
Luckily Blender has good reasons for it and after time these reasons
become clear. Blender's interface is built around providing you with
the shortest routes to the most results. It's also particularly focused
on reducing the kind of stress on wrists and hands that's often felt
when using mouse-intensive graphical applications every day.
